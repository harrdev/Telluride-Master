# Telluride-Master
Compete in ski competitions against another player.  A timer starts and the player avoids obstacles while seeing how long they can ski for before crashing.  The score of each player will be the time in seconds that they were up before crashing.

## MVP Goals
    * Core functionality
        1. Animation - All assets loaded in and moving
        2. Collision detection
        3. Logic - Crashes, score tracking, timer
        4. Basic sprites
        5. Winner announcement

## Stretch Goals
    1. Advanced sprites
    2. Smoother animation
    3. Sound / Music
    4. Speed boost "powerups"

## Potential Roadblocks
    * Time - 1 week to deliver
    * Logic with randomly appearing obstacles (trees, etc)

# Research These!
    1. When player presses down, game world scrolls up?
    2. Randomly placing trees below predetermined x-coords
    3. How accurate hit detection will be with odd shaped sprites, maybe cannot be really accurate?  Check into collision detection options
